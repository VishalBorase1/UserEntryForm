## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
It is a Simple User Entry Form Where User Can Submit there Name and any Entry which he want.
This Spring Boot Maven project is a simple application for managing "entries" with basic CRUD functionality. It features a RESTful API with endpoints to create (`POST /entries`) and retrieve (`GET /entries`) entries, leveraging Spring Data JPA for database operations on an H2 in-memory database. The project includes a main application class (`UserEntryApplication`), a REST controller (`EntryController`), an entity class (`Entry`), a repository interface (`EntryRepository`), and an HTML template (`index.html`) for a basic web page. Configuration is managed through `application.properties`.

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>
Use the Spring Boot REST controller that handles HTTP requests.
To deploy the Spring Boot Maven project, first build it using `mvn clean package` to create a JAR file in the `target` directory. Transfer this JAR file to your target server. On the server, run the application with `java -jar target/UserEntry-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`. Ensure necessary ports are open and verify the deployment by accessing the application endpoints via a web browser or API client. For production, consider running it as a service using systemd for automatic startup and management.
